**WORK**
Navy:
 - Description:
 - Challenge:
The Unit Readiness Evaluation (URE) is the next milestone event, and is conducted at the start of week 4. The URE tests the core skills that Recruits have been taught throughout their training to date, namely resilience, teamwork, time management, communal harmony, leadership and communication.
At sea the purpose of the URE is to achieve the appropriate level of readiness prior to Operational Deployment. In order to pass URE the ship must first demonstrate that it is capable of fighting in the warfare environment and able to control any subsequent damage control incidents. Once all these competencies have been completed the ship will then be evaluated during a 48 hour 'Warfare Scenario' where all competencies will be formally assessed to the limit.
URE commences with the Recruits first assessed RANPFT. Activities conducted during the Recruit School URE include an endurance circuit, a survival activity in the pool, and a sandpit team building exercise followed by a whole division physical activity in the afternoon. The URE brings together the skills that Recruits have learnt in their first 4 weeks. The following day after URE is the Executive Officer's (XO) Rounds. This is the first of three major inspections conducted by the Recruit School Command Team. For these rounds the Recruit School XO inspects the cleanliness of the accommodation block ablutions, block foyer, cabins, bunks, uniforms, and the state of each Recruit's locker. Recruits are required to put many hours of hard work and effort into ensuring all these areas are of the highest standard. Further, this is an important milestone in their training as it marks their transition from the Junior Class at Recruit School to the Intermediate Class.

Situations:
1. Incompetent co-worker
Discuss privately with coworker to understand any challenges they have, e.g. workload or clarity and offer help in a workflow or technical manner.
If persists I would bring it up with team lead, focusing on project needs rather than criticising.
Goal is to maintain project trajectory, whilst supporting team dynamics.
2. Issue on release
Communicate to team lead explanation of bug, potential consequences, possible workaround and time to fix it.
Ultimately the decision affects balancing user experience and project deadlines.
Regardless, transparency is eseential to maintain software quality and team trust.
3. Time Management/Learning new technology
Start by allocating time slots in my day for daily learning, ensuring doesn't interfere with current responsibilities.
I'd reach out to colleagues with experience for advice on what areas to focus on.
I'd develop practice projects in conjunction with a debugger and manual.
4. Disagreement

Group assessment:
understand where the company sits in the market and its business strategy/direction as well as how it differentiates itself from its competitors
