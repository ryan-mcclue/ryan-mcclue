## Essentials
* "Tell me about yourself":
`“I am a _____ at _____. In college I studied _____ at _____. Then I worked for _____ where I did _____. Then I worked for _____ where I did _____. In my current role, I’ve accomplished _____. In my free time, I enjoy _____.”`

I'm a computer science student studying my final year at UNSW. 
Prior to university I was a marine technician in the royal australian navy.
In my spare time, I'm working on a music visualiser app that's written in C.

* "Why should we hire you? What do you want to accomplish?"
My passion in programming is to write performant low-level software. 
I believe that aligns with Fujitsu's goal to innovate, as optimal software is able to push the boundaries of what is possible on the hardware.
In a personal project of mine, I worked on a music visualiser app that incorporated a from scratch UI system, overcoming a lot of bloat in common retained mode UI systems.
In addition, it featured a multithreaded file parser that optimised 1million entries've done this with musiliaser
However, I'm also willing to expand beyond just the technical side to provide business value whether that beand have an open mind work up front with clients.
navy gave me teamwork experience effectively communication with people of various backgrounds
Most of all, I'm willing to learn and better myself as a software engineer.
gives me good experience that I believe I can apply at Fujitsu.

* "What were your duties at the navy/previous-job?"
individual responsibilties such as kit mainteance, knowledge testing, physical fitness
teamwork ordering class in drills, conducting team based activities, group cleaning
quite simply learning to live with lots of people in close proximity
* "Why did you leave previous job?"
I'm incredidly appreciative of the opportunities provided to me and what I was able to learn,
however it just wasn't a good fit for me and now I'm looking for new challenges and want to grow

* "Top 5 strengths"
performace aware programming (multithreading, ILP, profiler)
UI design (from scratch im-gui)
data processing and analysis (streaming real-time audio, filtering and visualising in log scale)
team collaboration (navy)
quick learner (reading source code as documentation is applicable to many scenarios)

No answer:
At that point you think for a sec and if you can't think of anything just say 
"I can't think of one off the top of my head, 
but in general in that situation my approach is xyz

* "What's a typical day like?"
  "What are you favourite parts of the job?"
  "Opportunities for career advancement?"

## Base
 - Issue on Release:
  every team member was running windows model 
  noticed worse accuracy results on my ubuntu machine
  realised it was because os.listdir() un-fixed ordering on ubuntu
  as no indication of marker's OS, included accuracy note so as to not be penalised 
  Communicate to team lead explanation of bug, potential consequences, possible workaround and time to fix it.
  Ultimately the decision affects balancing user experience and project deadlines.
  Regardless, transparency is eseential to maintain software quality and team trust.
 - Poor Teammate:
   website project
   At standups, the members code did not pass integration tests and did not add any value to the system
Discuss privately with coworker to understand any challenges they have, e.g. workload or clarity and offer help in a workflow or technical manner.
If persists I would bring it up with team lead, focusing on project needs rather than criticising.
Goal is to maintain project trajectory, whilst supporting team dynamics.
 - Weakness:
  I'm a morning person, so towards the end of the work day, 
  my brain gets tired and I sometimes struggle with multitasking.
  However, I'm aware of this and to mitigate it I schedule complex tasks earlier in the day
  and also have food pick-me ups like tea or snacks and talk to people face-to-face to become more alert.
 - Initiative:
   * developing queue data structure in assembly as people were storing in registers becoming unweildy
   "During an assembly programming project, I noticed team members were inefficiently storing data in registers. I took the initiative to develop a queue data structure, which improved code organization and efficiency."
 - Most Challenging:
   * juggling various subjects and learning machine learning
     Time Management/Learning:
     I started chunking my work so I could spend several hours focused on similar tasks. One block for recruiting. One block for sales. One block for product. Once I figured out the secret to multitasking was to not multitask, it got a lot more manageable.”
     Start by allocating time slots in my day for daily learning, ensuring doesn't interfere with current responsibilities.
     I'd reach out to colleagues with experience for advice on what areas to focus on.
     I'd develop practice projects in conjunction with a debugger and manual.
 - Feedback:
   * navy performance reviews
"In the Navy, I received regular performance reviews. 
These evaluations helped me identify areas for improvement and reinforced my strengths,
contributing to my personal and professional growth."
 - Adversity:
   * sleep deprivation; pressure of responsibility affecting other's outcome
"During Navy training, I faced sleep deprivation and the pressure of responsibility affecting others' outcomes. This experience taught me to perform under stress and maintain focus even in challenging conditions."
 - Challenge:
   * overlay zsorting
 - Setback/Not-to-Plan:
   * visualisation not smooth (hann window, log)
 - Failure:
   * collating system metrics database was too slow, complicated/unweildy and not readily accessible
   remembered that the process failed, not necessarily me as a person.
   safeguards to not let happen again
"I once created a system metrics database that was too slow and unwieldy. I learned to focus on efficiency and user accessibility in database design. I implemented safeguards to prevent similar issues in future projects, remembering that processes can fail without it being a personal failure."
 - Mistake:
   * hospital corner 15cm and structure; instructor simulated a sea-side event and messed everyone's belongings up
 - Team Influence:
   * recruit school marching etc.
"During recruit school, I positively influenced my team during marching drills. By maintaining high standards and encouraging others, I helped improve our overall performance and unit cohesion."
 - Team Tough Decision:
   * waiting for navy class member to arrive so could leave as group
"We once had to decide whether to wait for a late team member before leaving as a group. This taught me the importance of balancing individual accountability with team unity."
 - Team Disagreement/Personality Clash:
   * URE team building exercises moving log with rope
"During a team-building exercise moving a log with ropes, disagreements arose. I learned to approach conflicts empathetically, address concerns directly, and focus on finding common ground. I now aim to maintain professionalism, ask questions instead of confronting, and demonstrate ideas by weighing pros and cons."

Taking the time to consider what negative reaction they might have and making the effort to be empathetic allowed me to directly address their concerns and show them that this was the best way forward.”
regardless of disagreements, important to act professional.
treating them poorly often results in them returning the favour.
keep in mind that they could be going through a hard time themselves, and they're taking anger out on you.
if persists, best to keep your distance.
ask questions instead of saying outwrite wrong; 
demonstrate idea getting pros and cons

 - Team Challenging Interaction:
   * smoke break members not being able to contribute to cleaning rooms
    identifying the root issue of a conflict and addressing that directly without bringing in other issues, which is how I aim to handle any disagreement in the workplace.
     It took some careful listening on my part to understand he felt like it wasn’t the best use of his time given the workload he was juggling. I made sure to acknowledge his concern. 
 - Team Motivation:
   * swim with clothes off members struggling to swim
I motivated them by breaking the task into manageable steps and offering encouragement. This experience taught me the value of empathy and positive reinforcement in team settings.
 - Team Perceptions of You:
   * proactive university group assignments creating git and project scaffold
     collaborative asking for advice in areas unfamilar with like machine learning
     capable always maintained infront during PT exercises

The Unit Readiness Evaluation (URE) is the next milestone event, and is conducted at the start of week 4. The URE tests the core skills that Recruits have been taught throughout their training to date, namely resilience, teamwork, time management, communal harmony, leadership and communication.
At sea the purpose of the URE is to achieve the appropriate level of readiness prior to Operational Deployment. In order to pass URE the ship must first demonstrate that it is capable of fighting in the warfare environment and able to control any subsequent damage control incidents. Once all these competencies have been completed the ship will then be evaluated during a 48 hour 'Warfare Scenario' where all competencies will be formally assessed to the limit.
URE commences with the Recruits first assessed RANPFT. Activities conducted during the Recruit School URE include an endurance circuit, a survival activity in the pool, and a sandpit team building exercise followed by a whole division physical activity in the afternoon. The URE brings together the skills that Recruits have learnt in their first 4 weeks. The following day after URE is the Executive Officer's (XO) Rounds. This is the first of three major inspections conducted by the Recruit School Command Team. For these rounds the Recruit School XO inspects the cleanliness of the accommodation block ablutions, block foyer, cabins, bunks, uniforms, and the state of each Recruit's locker. Recruits are required to put many hours of hard work and effort into ensuring all these areas are of the highest standard. Further, this is an important milestone in their training as it marks their transition from the Junior Class at Recruit School to the Intermediate Class.
