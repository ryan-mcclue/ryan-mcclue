<!-- TODO(Ryan): Mention specific technologies as appropriate to job application -->
### Skills Demonstrated 
**UI** (some REST API with libcurl)
ui elements, panning, zooming, etc.
possibly shaders and metaprogramming
CI, testing, analyser basics

**Embedded**
state machine, driver writing

**Algos?** 
provide examples for languages desired in job

try and work with at least every major data structure and algorithm category

### Volunteer Work

### Referees

have to communicate the value you gained from each project to the recruiter/engineer that will read your portfolio.

### Challenges
## UNSW AVR Microprocessors
SREG not being saved in avr interrupt
signed comparison/branching/add/sub specifics and code flow jumps in assembly
mul instruction copying to r0, r1

## STM32
* ground loops with nokia screen
* simulator build etc.

## Linux Bluetooth 
* ell library read test files for documentation
* linux OS examples such as input, analysing SDL2 source
* use of set -x in bash scripts will exit if subprocess returns an error, even if 2>/dev/null. Cryptic!
* Polling multiple keyboards lag due to bug in gnome. inspect gnome git
  switched to desktop environment to lxfe 4. also makes creating shortcuts a breeze (laptop and desktop keyboard)
* Implementing hotloading file modification time being read too early
