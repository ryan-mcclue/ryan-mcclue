To whom it may concern,
I'm writing to be considered for the <Graduate Program 2025> opening that was posted on your <Careers Page>.

Aldi's emphasis on good people and purpose
The opportunity to make an impact and to learn as much as 
possible about software engineering as a career at <Fujitsu> is an exciting prospect.

To introduce myself a little, 
I'm a Computer Science student with previous military experience, completing my 4th and final year at UNSW.
By applying my skills gained through previous technical, academic and work experiences,
I'm confident that I can make an immediate contribution to <Fujitsu>.

I learned a great deal of technical skills developing a C/C++ Music Visualiser app as a personal project.
It featured a from-scratch animated graphical user interface, <creating an engaging user experience>
In addition, it utilised a multithreaded file loader, <resulting in performant system operation> 
Furthermore, a CI workflow was used to run static and dynamic analysis, <improving code security and reliability>
Finally, code and assets were hotreloadable at runtime, <offering a flexible design process>

I also have work experience in the Royal Australian Navy, where I learned a number of important soft skills.
At HMAS Cerberus, I both participated and led a class of 24 in training drills, <requiring strong leadership and communication skills.>
I also lived/worked collaboratively in a team of 6, tackling mentally and physically demanding daily tasks. 
<This experience honed my ability to perform under pressure and excel in high-stakes environments.>

During my university studies, I gained valuable experience in <collaborative coding> through various group projects. 
These projects included a custom object detection algorithm, a microcontroller traffic controller and a forum-style web application.
These projects improved my <ability to code in a team>, while <exposing me to a wide range of technologies.>
(Furthermore, my high distinction average mark demonstrates my ability to acheive at a high standard.)

For these reasons, I feel my background would fit well with <Fujitsu>. 
I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you further about this position.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
