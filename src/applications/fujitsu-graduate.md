* Please describe your key skills and how you can apply these to help Fujitsu achieve its purpose which is: 
  to make the world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation.
My experience working on complex technical projects from scratch, such as a music visualiser GUI app, provides me with a strong knowledge base of various problem domains, e.g. UI, optimisation, algorithmic etc.
I can use this versatility to help develop sustainable technologies that address complex societal challenges.
I have strong problem solving skills that I developed working on various university projects, e.g. genetic algorithm, AI minimax solver etc.
I can draw on these to help develop unique solutions that are essential for innovation.
I developed teamwork and leadership skills through my time in the Royal Australian Navy.
Using these soft skills, I can effectively collaborate with others to ensure that sustainable solutions are implemented effectively.

* What does purpose mean to you? How do you translate your purpose into meaningful action in the community around you?
Purpose means having a clear direction and motivation.
My volunteer work with Guide Dogs NSW/ACT taught me the power of contributing to initiatives that directly impact people's lives.
My purpose as an aspiring software engineer is to create high reliable and performance software.
By creating projects that have the potential to solve real-world problems such as GUI music player, I align my personal goals with broader societal needs.
By consistently learning new skills, from my university to personal projects, I'm able to stay up-to-date with current technologies to help contribute positively to society.
My leadership experience in the Navy taught me that by supporting others you can help cultivate certain skills that result in wider positive change.
