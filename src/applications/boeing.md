excited to take up the great degree of responsibilitiy of software that must never break
produce complex software using modern techniques

To whom it may concern,
I'm writing to be considered for the Graduate Software Engineer position that was posted on your Job's Page. 
The opportunity to contribute towards Australia's defence systems through software and to learn
more about software engineering as a career at Boeing is an exciting prospect.
As a final year Computer Science student at UNSW with previous military experience, 
I believe I can contribute a unique skillset to make an immediate contribution to Boeing.

Developing a C/C++ Music Visualiser app as a personal project, I learned a great deal about low level programming.
It featured a from-scratch immediate mode GUI, multithreaded file loader, hot reloadable system and CI workflow.
Acheiving these features required foundational knowledge about data structures, algorithms, memory management and underlying system architecture.
This project demonstrates I can work in a conscientous manner and understand how to program with minimal dependencies, as many embedded systems dictate.

My experience in the Royal Australian Navy taught me the importance of serving (work affects others) and working as a team.
At HMAS Cerberus, I both participated and led a class of 24 in training drills, <requiring strong leadership and communication skills.>
I also lived/worked collaboratively in a team of 6, tackling mentally and physically demanding daily tasks. 
I believe this provides me a greater understanding of the context of deployment of Boeing's systems 
me to greater empathise with the users of the software than a traditional software graduate.

My experience in the Royal Australian Navy taught me the importance of service and teamwork, understanding that my work affects others. 
At HMAS Cerberus, I both participated in and led a class of 24 in training drills, which honed my leadership and communication skills. 
These abilities are crucial when working in Boeing's diverse, multi-disciplinary teams to deliver innovative solutions to the Australian Defence Force.


My web development work for Hannah Alice Photography, learned about client discussion and requirements management.
Manage project scope and client expectations.
Deliver solutions that balance technical considerations with user needs.



For these reasons, I feel my background would fit well with Boeing. 
I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you further about this position.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
