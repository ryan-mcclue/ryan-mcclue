excited to take up the great degree of responsibilitiy of software that must never break
produce complex software using modern techniques

To whom it may concern,
I'm writing to be considered for the Graduate Software Engineer position that was posted on your Job's Page. 
The opportunity to contribute towards Australia's defence systems through software and to learn
more about software engineering as a career at Boeing is an exciting prospect.
As a final year Computer Science student at UNSW with previous military experience, 
I believe I can contribute a unique skillset to make an immediate contribution to Boeing.

Developing a C/C++ Music Visualiser app as a personal project, I learned a great deal about low level programming.
It featured a from-scratch immediate mode GUI, multithreaded file loader, hot reloadable system and CI workflow.
Acheiving these features required foundational knowledge about data structures, algorithms, memory management and underlying system architecture.
This project demonstrates I can work in a conscientous manner and understand how to program with minimal dependencies, as many of Boeing's systems require.

My experience in the Royal Australian Navy taught me the importance of service and teamwork.
At HMAS Cerberus, I participated and led marching drills as well as worked collaboratively to tackle mentally and physically demanding tasks on a daily basis.
These experiences honed my soft skills and instilled in me a deep appreciation for hard work, providing a solid foundation 
to thrive in Boeing's diverse and multidisciplinary teams.
Furthermore, this gives me a unique perspective of Boeing's end user's needs.
The importance of reliable, efficient and easy to use defence systems is something I greatly appreciate. 

My web development work for Hannah Alice Photography provided me with valuable experience in requirements management.
Conducting client consultations, I had to convert the client's vision into concrete technical requirements. 
In addition, I had to manage scope and effectively estimate the website's progress.
This developed my ability to actively listen and understand complex needs.
I can draw upon these skills to help transform broad mission objectives into specific software features for Boeing's defence systems.

For these reasons, I feel my background would fit well with Boeing. 
I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you further about this position.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
