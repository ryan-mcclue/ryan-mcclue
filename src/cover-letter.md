Hi there,
I saw your job posting on Hacker News and it sounds like an interesting opportunity!
To introduce myself a little, I'm a generalist full stack web developer and have been developing
apps over the past several years. My most well known projects have been X, Y, and Z. X is a
social network / dating site that I grew to 2 million users. Y is a social game that began on
Facebook with 1.5 million users, which I later brought to iPhone. Z is an open source GitHub
framework that I am developing. Most of my tech stack has been built on Python, React.js,
MySql, HTML, and CSS so I feel my background would fit well with <your_company>.
Here are the URLs of some of my previous work.
http://x.com/

Please let me know if you'd like to chat. I'll also attach a resume.
Cheers,
<your name>
