To whom it may concern,
I'm writing to be considered for the <Graduate Program 2025> opening that was posted on your <Careers Page>.

The opportunity to make an impact and to learn as much as 
possible about software engineering as a career at <Fujitsu> is an exciting prospect.

To introduce myself a little, 
I'm a Computer Science student with previous military experience, completing my 4th and final year at UNSW.
By applying my skills gained through previous technical, academic and work experiences,
I'm confident that I can make an immediate contribution to <Fujitsu>.

I learned a great deal of technical skills developing a C/C++ Music Visualiser app as a personal project.
It featured a from-scratch animated graphical user interface, <creating an engaging user experience>
In addition, it utilised a multithreaded file loader, <resulting in performant system operation> 
Furthermore, a CI workflow was used to run static and dynamic analysis, <improving code security and reliability>
Finally, code and assets were hotreloadable at runtime, <offering a flexible design process>

I also have work experience in the Royal Australian Navy, where I learned a number of important soft skills.
At HMAS Cerberus, I both participated and led a class of 24 in training drills, <requiring strong leadership and communication skills.>
I also lived/worked collaboratively in a team of 6, tackling mentally and physically demanding daily tasks. 
<This experience honed my ability to perform under pressure and excel in high-stakes environments.>

During my university studies, I gained valuable experience in collaborative coding through various group projects. These projects, spanning diverse software disciplines, included:
A custom object detection algorithm using ensemble learning
A microcontroller-based traffic controller simulation
A forum-style web application with full CRUD functionality
These collaborative endeavors taught me <ability to code in a team> while exposing me to a wide range of technologies and methodologies.

Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently maintained a High Distinction average, demonstrating <high standards> in both individual and team-based work across multiple software disciplines. This combination of practical experience and academic excellence reflects my ability to apply theoretical knowledge effectively in collaborative environments.

I gained exposure to coding as a team during my university studies.
Group projects such as a custom object detection algorithm, microcontroller traffic controller and forum-style web app taught me ...
Throughout university, I have maintained a HD mark, shows that I'm able to work on a team in a diverse range of software disciplines.

For these reasons, I feel my background would fit well with <Fujitsu>. 
I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you further about this position.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Ryan McClue
