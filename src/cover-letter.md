To whom it may concern,
I'm writing to be considered for the <Graduate Program 2025> opening that was posted on your <Careers Page>.

(TAILOR TO JOB OFFERING) <e.g. mentorship offered etc.>

possible about software engineering as a career at <Fujitsu> is an exciting prospect.

To introduce myself a little, 
I'm in my final year of a Computer Science degree at UNSW,
and have an interest in low level programming.
By applying my skills gained through previous technical and work experiences,
I'm confident that I can make an immediate contribution to <Fujitsu>.

My most recent technical project is a Music Visualiser app in C/C++.
It features a from-scratch graphical user interface with animations, demonstrating <skill>
In addition, it also contains multithreaded optimisation programming, showcasing <skill> 
Furthermore, there is a hotreloading system, offering rapid developer iteration, <skill>

I also have work experience in the Royal Australian Navy.
At HMAS Cerberus, I both participated and led a class of 24 in training drills, requiring strong leadership and communication skills.
