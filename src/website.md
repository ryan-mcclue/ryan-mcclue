At least with self hosted Wordpress you know that you can swap hosts and the infrastructure is seperate from normal operations. 
Plus wordpress as a cms won’t die anytime soon (unlike weebly being bought out by square). 

Just buy hosting from any reputable host (crazy domains, site ground, tomedia hosting, go daddy) 
and 90% of the time they have an automated tool to install it. 

Then just read up on how to use it (like you will have to do for anything you do). 
Buy a domain and connect it (again, just follow what the host says)

In regards to your invoices there’s probably a plug-in for that but my experience is it’s best to use a seperate thing like Xero or MYOB to manage that, instead of linking it to the website, since it’s not really needed there. 
Otherwise woocommerce (a wordpress plug-in) may have a way to do it.


TODO: when making a website for someone, do you register domain name in their name?

TODO: build template specific market website, e.g hairdresser and target that area
But overall, all they need is a home, about, services, portfolio, contact setup (5 pages)

regarding price, say how much is a new client worth? brings in 1 client, worth it

register domain under clients name, with your account

“my name is Ryan and I’m actually a stay-at-home dad web developer 
and I found you on Google and I found you on Google but I didn’t see a website anywhere, so I wanted to at least call and see if you needed any help with one.” 

- From there, I’ll send you an email with questions about your business and what you do so I can have a good idea of what content we need on the site. I’ll send you some demo links to website designs that I think would look good for you and you tell me which you like best and why. 
- I’ll take your questionnaire answers and designs you liked and hand it over to my designer who will make something unique for you. Once she’s finished, I’ll send you a link to see my screen and we go over the design together to make sure you like it all or any changes you’d like to see. 
  (show them design with google meets video call sharing screen?)

  (search 3 hairdresser templates and send them over to see which one they like best)
- Once design approved, put content in
 Hero 3-4 main services About Side by side image/content section for a particular service to rank on google Extra services Gallery Faq Why choose us Reviews Footer
This is the standard layout and content needed. You can tell him that we put the 3-4 main services at the top (the big ticket ones) and the reviews at the bottom because people don’t remember the middle of the website. They only remember the first and last part. So we put only 3-4 main services at the top so they’re easy to remember, and reviews at the bottom so when people leave the site they remember the big ticket services they do and the nice things people said about them and have a positive experience. 

- Give them google drive link to put photos in
