## SETUP
Hi [],
As Mum mentioned,
I'm doing a late career change and need something to stand out on my resume.
I really appreciate the opportunity to create a website for your business.
I'm sure it will improve your online presence and drive customer growth.

Although I'm not charging for creating the website, there are ongoing fees for maintaining a website:
  1. Registering website name ($47.90 for 3 years, $24 for 1 year) 
  2. Server hosting ($7.95/month for 12 months)
If you're comfortable with this, continue on.

To register your website name, I'll need this information from you:
- Desired Website Name (e.g. traceyhairdressers.com.au):
- Your full name:
- Address:
- Mobile Number:
- If you want a website name ending with '.au' 
  - Entity Type (Company, Registered Business, Sole Trader):
  - Legal Entity Name:
  - Identification type (ACN, ABN, ARBN):
  - Identification number:

Regarding the website structure, I'm thinking of 4 pages: 
1. Home page, e.g:

Once I here back from you with the necessary information, I'll develop a preliminary design with placeholder text.
I'll send you a link where you can explore the website and see if you like it.
If all clear, I'll finalise everything and give you instructions on how to update the text and photos yourself for what you want.
Or, you can send me the content and I can do the necessary changes. Whatever works for you.
