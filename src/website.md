At least with self hosted Wordpress you know that you can swap hosts and the infrastructure is seperate from normal operations. 
Plus wordpress as a cms won’t die anytime soon (unlike weebly being bought out by square). 

Just buy hosting from any reputable host (crazy domains, site ground, tomedia hosting, go daddy) 
and 90% of the time they have an automated tool to install it. 

Then just read up on how to use it (like you will have to do for anything you do). 
Buy a domain and connect it (again, just follow what the host says)

In regards to your invoices there’s probably a plug-in for that but my experience is it’s best to use a seperate thing like Xero or MYOB to manage that, instead of linking it to the website, since it’s not really needed there. 
Otherwise woocommerce (a wordpress plug-in) may have a way to do it.
