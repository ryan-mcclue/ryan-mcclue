### FAQ
What should I wear?
A.
I will always suggest pastels, muted tones, light neutrals and/or earthy colours! Think beige, creams, whites, taupe, tan, navy, black, mossy greens! These colours and tones are timeless and work really well in photographs.
However, I will never discourage you from wearing what you want to wear! So if you have a favourite outfit or theme you want to achieve with the shoot - 100% go for it!
Think: simple is stunning! and wear something you feel comfortable in!

What if I want something not covered in a package?
A.I will happily cover a range of photo ideas you would like done! Including but not limited to pregnancy announcements, gender reveals, first birthday cake smashes and more! Please get in touch to discuss further.

What area do you service?
A.Greater Western Sydney including the Blue Mountains, Penrith & Hawkesbury areas.

How long until I get my photos?
2-6weeks!

What time is golden hour?
A.If you're wanting 'Golden Hour' photos, typically this is the last hour before sunset and the first hour after sunrise is best.
Days where there is minimal cloud coverage give the best golden hour shooting conditions - simply magic!

When should I get maternity photo's done?
IN my opinion, maternity photo's are bet done in the third trimester - around 34-36 weeks!
I would really like a studio session, is that possible with you?

A.Yes! With notice, studio sessions can be organised. I often find these are ideal for newborn and maternity shoots! But are also perfect for whatever you are wanting!
Studio sessions do incur an extra fee so get in touch and we can discuss further!

Where can I get newborn photo's done?
A.I will happily come and do newborn photo's at your house or we can organise a studio photo session!
Either way, lots of natural lighting is best!!!! Sadly dark, dimly lit rooms without any natural lighting can make for poor images.

## SETUP
Hi [],
As Mum mentioned,
I'm doing a late career change and need something to stand out on my resume.
I really appreciate the opportunity to create a website for your business.
I'm sure it will improve your online presence and drive customer growth.

Although I'm not charging for creating the website, there are ongoing fees for maintaining a website:
  1. Registering website name ($47.90 for 3 years, $24 for 1 year) 
  2. Server hosting ($7.95/month for 12 months)
If you're comfortable with this, continue on.

To register your website name, I'll need this information from you:
- Desired Website Name (e.g. traceyhairdressers.com.au):
- Your full name:
- Address:
- Mobile Number:
- If you want a website name ending with '.au' 
  - Entity Type (Company, Registered Business, Sole Trader):
  - Legal Entity Name:
  - Identification type (ACN, ABN, ARBN):
  - Identification number:

Regarding the website structure, I'm thinking of 4 pages: 
1. Home page, e.g:
