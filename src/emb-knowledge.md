## Deployment
MCU parametric selection using microchip/maps
"I need the cheapest part I can get, for multiple 10K unit production runs with one SPI bus, one I2S  bus, DMA channels and a handful of GPIOs 
with at least one ADC input. QSPI / SDIO is a nice to have, but I can get by with regular SPI if necessary."
* I2S most obscure so select first
* counting IO pins of protocols gives minimum
* if looking for cheap, probably have low number of pins overall so set max. pin count
(remove 'future' devices to not show unlisted prices)
* add to side-by-side, e.g. cheapest might be MIPS, so compare with say ARM

* Automotive: car require wide temperature ranges
* Aerospace: radiation hardening (backup mcus, physical shielding, etc.)
* Underwater: pressure resistance
* Military: shock and vibration resistance
