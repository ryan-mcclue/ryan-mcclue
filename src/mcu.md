As debugging is much harder on embedded, require more logging?
Also, unit testing on host machine further reduces debugging difficulty

One of my last technical interviews I botched because I was asked to draw a block diagram for an embedded medical device.
Know how to read some timing diagrams also

An op-amp is a voltage amplifying device. 
It cannot output more than the supply voltage, i.e. it has a power supply (these are normally left off circuit diagrams)
Very versatile analog logic operations, e.g. voltage adder, comparator; hence name 'operational'
Can also amplify/invert/maintain signal


Shift register adds additional output or inputs to be added, i.e. saves pins
It does this via converting between serial and parallel, 
e.g SIPO (Serial-In Parallel-Out; LEDs), PISO (buttons)
Shift register will have chip enable pin


LOGIC:
Floating means voltage ranges will be between threshold values, and so no certainty as what result will be
* TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) uses bipolar transistors
Threshold voltage levels:
  - Voh (minimum) 2.7V
  - Vih 2V
  - Vol (maximum) 0.4V
  - Vil 0.8V
* CMOS uses field effect transistors. Less power, more sensitive
  - Voh (minimum) 2.4V
  - Vih 2V
  - Vol (maximum) 0.5V
  - Vil 0.8V

GPIO:
* Pin
* Output/Input
* Push-Pull
* Alternate (uart, dac, xtal (clock-in say with function generator), clock-out, rtc, TODO: ...)
* Pull up/down

INTERRUPT:
They are meant for real-time interaction as opposed to tasks.
Typically, will just service interrupt flag and perhaps unlock a semaphore.
A high priority interrupt associated with a high priority task
Offload bus polling which might affect DMA controllers, lowers battery usage
Polling can be deterministic, and if on very fast machine e.g. millions of IOPS (IO Operations Per Second) cost of context switching in interrupt not efficient
So, interrupt when want to react instantly or want to be asleep
(soft interrupt is when attached to an output)
* Falling/Rising/Any
* Per-pin or entire ISR
* Priority
* Populate queue workflow/

ADC:
* ENOB (Effective Number Of Bits)?

TIMER:
More general-purpose than systick, e.g. PWM output?
systick is for accurately capturing wall-time
* Source
* Direction
* Resolution, i.e. Comparator value
* One-shot/Reload
-> common to retrieve timer value inside of timer interrupt
TODO: why use timer instead of just use systick in main loop?

SPI:
Serial Peripheral Interface
* Short distance
* Synchronous
* Full-duplex
* SCK, MISO, MOSI, SS pins
The SS active-low pin used to select particular slave. 
Therefore, each slave has it's own separate SS line.
This makes signal routing on a PCB more difficult

I2C:
Inter-Integrated Circuit
(Intel released SMBus I2C variant 10KHz-100KHz)
* Serial
* Synchronous
* Half-duplex
* Short distance
* Multi-master (i.e. multiple masters and multiple slaves) bus superiority over SPI. 
* SCL, SDA lines
more complex than SPI, less than UART
modern I2C ultra-fast supports up to 5MHz, slave address size 10bit
bus connections are open-drain, thereby faciliting each signal line having a pull-up resistor to
restore signal to high when no device asserting it low
(this may be built into sensor, however for multiple devices may have to manually add one)

USART:
Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter.
UART subset (asynchronous means no clock signal to synchronise bits)
Serial
Full-duplex
UART is a hardware protocol designed for asynchronous data streams.
TX, RX lines
Universal means various protocols
The different protocols handled use different numbers of bits for detecting start and stop conditions, 
presence or absence of a parity bit (and its polarity), and frame data lengths. 
Typically you can specify 5,6,7 or 8 data bits per frame. 
If someone were to insist that his/her data must be formatted into 4-bit frames, no existing UART chip would be able to handle it.

FTDI is a semiconductor company.
Prominent product is USB to UART chip 

* Flow Control
May implement hardware flow-control; how serial devices control amount of data transmitting, as often PC faster than MCU
RTS (Request To Send), CTS (Clear To Send) will be wired to each other from opposite devices.
When high, saying that can receive data, i.e. not busy with other tasks, buffer space available etc.

Referring to single wire:
* Simplex has data flowing in one way only. Therefore is unidirectional
* Half-Duplex can have data flowing in both directions, but only one at a time. Therefore is bidirectional
* Full-Duplex can have data flowing in both directions at the same time
Data sending:
* Serial sends bits one after another 
  Serial offers space-economy, which also allows for better sheilding and cheaper, therefore better at long distances
  - Synchronous pairs data lines with clock signal, often faster
    Could sample on falling or rising edge 
    Setting speed isn't important, although there is maximum speed
  - Asynchronous requires more effort in sending data reliably, i.e. framing with 9600-8N1
    No guarantee that both sides are running at the same rate
    Extra hardware required, can result in garbage data if both sides baud doesn't match, doesn't scale for multiple devices
* Parallel sends multiple bits at the same time. Typically involves a 'bus'


USART has extra clock signal, so higher data rates as knows when to sample as oppose to having to inspect data

9600-8N1 will have 9600 baud, 8 data bits, no parity bit, 1 start/stop bit
Therefore, will have an effective data rate of 80%
Typically LSB first
* RS232 (-13V - 13V), TTL (0V - 5V) specify voltage levels, i.e. hardware
RS232 has higher voltage range for less noise susceptibility over long distances
(in reality no modern RS232 uses these high voltages)
UART is protocol for sending/recieving bits. 
* RS232 OSCILLOSCOPE DECODING: 
When idle, 3.3V 
Start bit is low, stop bit is high
Can see is a software decoder via: utility -> options -> installed
math -> decoder1 -> (evt. table)
(oscilloscope gave ringing as period was way to low at ns, wanted Âµs)
oscilloscope with memory depth of 54Mpts can record a total of 54mil samples in its memory
by default, as alter time scale, memory depth and sample rate automatically adjusted so that capture fills the screen
acquire -> mem-depth
increasing memory depth to max. will slow down scope

Use scope to check levels (logic analyser may just read 0), see if things look right,
timing, noise, real-time, analogue

logic analyser for long term patterns

DAC:
DAC coupled with OpAmp can act as dynamically adjustable current source
Pressure and flow control devices, e.g. 4-20 (range between 4-20mA), 0-10 
* Channels
* Resolution (like 8bit?)
* Voltage reference? e.g. is power supply 3.3v than output max. is 3.3v?
wave/function generator might be tied to RTC? 
attenuation is opposite of amplification, e.g. amplitude attenuation
wave phase is position of wave at a point in time, i.e. where wave is positioned in its cycle

ADC:
Although Nyquist states double sampling rate, with DSP tricks can lower required sampling rate to reduce power
* Sampling rate
* Resolution
* Noise?
* SAR?

DMA:

DSP:
Has analog (Fourier, Laplace, Convolution, analog filtering) and digital domain (Sampling theorem, aliasing, FIR, IIR, FFT)

signal (frequency, period) is continuous -> record at evenly spaced intervals into samples <---> compute spectrum

Can move data from one memory location to almost anywhere in memory map, as long as permitted by MPU
Juypter notebook is a standard for embedding python code in a markdown style and presenting them 
Conda can install postgresql as well as python packages
Miniconda is distribution that primarily includes conda

Time-invariant is one whose behaviour (response to inputs) does not change over time.

Do we always deal with linear systems?

Higher frequency (vibrations per second), higher pitch (what our ears actually percieve)

An envelope (family of curves) describes the amplitude or changing level of the signal over time.
So, could be thought of a smooth curve outlining wave's extremes

Apodisation modifies mathematical function.
Typically used to smooth discontinuities at start and end of wave

Spectrum is frequency content of wave

Low pass attenuates frequencies higher

FFT algorithm underpins (Laplace is in similar breath to FFT?)
Ears do something similar to spectral analysis, i.e. FFT?

(FFT + Convolution Theory + LTI theory)
* LTI system theory to characterise acoustics of space
Then can convolve (combine 2 functions to create a 3rd) a wave with another to have the wave sound like it was played in the same room as the other


Bus Pirate has Microchip PIC (MPLab compiler for AVR as well) as a SOIC (Small Outline Integrated Circuit) IC package type

Although oscilloscope for analog, can show ringing even for analog signals?


CubeMX as just project configuration.
CubeIDE more encompassing, i.e. a superset
Rather depressingly it's better than CCS (TI) or MPLab (Microchip), 
particularly for pin-out configuration
Many quirks, e.g. MSP meaning MCU support package which is like HAL startup
Why strive towards libopencm3
(also automatically adds libc)



Experience with GUI, e.g. workspaces, differentiating board revisions, 
board selection (board type discovery kit, mcu name), .ioc (initialisation files),
adding files in with GUI to have them 'differentiated',
dragging out tab to have split code view,
project properties to alter include and source paths for release and debug builds,
project setting tab indentation,
Right-click 'open declaration' to inspect source,
Gives simple one click flash and debugger,
As not autogenerated, must copy all firmware files manually into project (don't bother copying template files, as aspect of HAL not used)
Have to clean build to remove object files that may reference symbols from deleted files,
quirk of pushing to github only when IDE is shut

C++ classes, 'clean code' like header and source file declarations and definitions

IMPORTANT: debugger will skip over empty return statements, which can make you think a function is not
being called or exiting, e.g. HAL_GetTick() inside of HAL_Delay()
IMPORTANT: just be chill when there is a bug and don't get overly frustrated. 
makes programming much more fun. they're going to happen. it's ok
IMPORTANT: debugging, read through parameters clearly!

Default sets up GPIO, NVIC and SYS (system manager controller?)
Max out the HCLK in the clock diagram as we are not running off battery.
The clock diagram helps find solutions of values of PLLs and dividers/scalers.
Also shows how clocks laid out on the device and what busses etc. (there are quite a few of them)
We choose the HSE 25MHz crystal on the board and run this through the PLL.
We will then manually set bus speeds etc.  
(page useful if say I want this speed on the peripheral, how can I acheive that?
take the settings shown and put that in manually in code)
HAL generated is not exactly performant, however useful for setting things up.
However, probably use register direct for interrupts as want performance out of the box
With HAL, typically enable what drivers we want in source, 
e.g. ADC, DMA2D, SDRAM (additional ram), DSI, LTDC (LCD TFT Display Controller),
QSPI (for additional flash), RTC, RNG, SD (implement FATfs), TIM, SPI, UART, EXTI


Interrupt handler required for systick?

Comments:
header comment allows easy glance to obtain any context specific information about file
function comment same deal, however only use if not obvious
series of statement comments before writing section, e.g. // System initialise

code distinctions typically core, system and driver

So we can see at a glance:
handlers.cpp for interrupt and exception handlers 
(
An exception is a condition that changes normal flow of program>
in ARM, interrupt is a type of exception. 
synchronous will fire immediately after instruction,
asynchronous don't fire immediately 
an exception could be pending even if disabled
Cortex-M defines essential reserved exceptions:
* Reset: Called on startup
* NMI
* Hardfault: Catch all for dereferencing NULL, out-of-bounds memory, divide-by-zero
(however finer grain control in say armv8-m like MemManage, BusFault etc.)
* SVCall: svc instruction
* PendSV and SysTick: Triggered by software typically used in schedulers (put in HAL_IncTick() for HAL_Delay())
External interrupts, as in external to core, e.g. to DMA start from 16.
Configured with NVIC peripheral
External interrupts will typically be implemented as weak symbols, so no need to define them
However for exception handlers do.
IMPORTANT: If in C++, have to extern "C" exception handler functions
)

RCC (reset clock control)

boot.cpp for clocks, caches, etc. i.e. before processing super-loop
* initialising Icache and Dcache mean allocating into more than actually turning on?
* turn on ART

setup.hpp for interrupt/dma priorities, include HAL files, alternate function listing
* port/pin mappings

Look in startup.s file
Copy over exception labels and make functions into handlers.cpp

IMPORTANT: Various compilers shipped with various IDEs is perhaps when coding to the C
standard is important, e.g. cubeide does not support #pragma once

Debugging:
Green LED as a heartbeat so know haven't locked up
Red LED is encountered exception

462 DMIPS

GPIO pins are implemented as tri-state buffer, i.e. 3 states
Hi-Z means floating, i.e. no pull-up (to VCC) or pull-down resistor
It allows multiple devices to share the same IO line

A current sink means current is flowing into the pin

GPIO push-pull has the ability to both source and sink current
open-drain/open-collector can only sink current, i.e. can only drive signal line low

High-drive GPIO are push-pull pins capable of providing more current than typical pins, e.g. for LED


CAN (Controller Area Network) is a CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection) to allow
electronic subsystems to be connected and interact in a network.
So, each node on the bus must wait for a period of inactivity before attempting to send a message
CAN FD (flexible data-rate) allows for higher bandwidth

### MOTORS:
Phase refers to how many electromagnet bars in rotor, e.g. 3-phase each placed at 120Â°
AC typically induction motor. Synchronous or asynchronous, i.e. whether the shaft rotates in sync with the polarity changes in the rotor 
DC can be brushed or brushless. Brushes are connected to electrodes on the end of the shaft to magentise sections of the rotor as the shaft rotates.
Brushless requires ESC to mimic AC pulses
Stepper brushless most precise movement requiring stepper controller
Servo motor can be AC or DC that provides feedback so can move to a particular position with PWM

TODO: working with thumb instructions
why not always use?

TODO: bootloader

The CPU architecture will have an exception (a cpu interrupt) model. 
Here, reset behaviour will be defined.
as often harvard archicture
different evaluation boards use different ICDI (in-circuit debug interfaces) 
to flash through SWD via usb-b
e.g. texas instruments use stellaris, stm32 ST-link
To avoid unknown state, 
drive with external source, e.g. ground or voltage.

Pull-up/down resistors are to used for unconnected input pins to avoid floating state
So, a pull-down will have the pin (when in an unconnected state) to ground, i.e. 0V when switch is not on

IMPORTANT: Although enabling internal resistors, 
must look at board schematic as external resistors might overrule

Vdd (drain, power supply to chip)
Vcc (collector, subsection of chip, i.e. supply voltage of circuit)
Vss (sink, ground)
Vee (emitter, ground)

RC (resistor-capacitor) oscillator generates sine wave by charging and discharging periodically (555 astable timer)
internal mcu oscillators typically RC, so subject to frequency variability

Will have clock sources, e.g. HSI, HSE, PLL. output of these is SYSCLK.
SYSCLK is what would use to calculate cpu instruction cycles.

a clock is an oscillator with a counter that records number of cycles since being initialised

Crystal generates stable frequency
PLL is type of clock circuit that allows for high frequency, reliable clock generation (setup also affords easy clock duplication and clock manipulation)
So, PLL system could have RC or crystal input
Feeding into it is a reference input (typically a crystal oscillator) which goes into a voltage controlled oscillator to output frequency
The feedback of the output frequency into the initial phase detector can be changed
Adding dividers/pre-scalers into this circuit allows to get programmable voltage.
So, a combination of stable crystal (however generate relatively slow signal, e.g. 100MHz) and high frequency RC oscillators (a type of VCO; voltage controlled oscillator)

first step in embedded debugging commandments;
thou shalt check voltage 
(e.g. check 5V going to LCD by placing multimeter on soldered pin heads)

is power profiler kit specific to each board necessary, e.g. nordic, stm32?

stm32 datasheet and reference manual (documents of different depths about same mcu) nomenclature
will have 'Application Notes' that detail specific features like CCM RAM
datasheet will often be related to a family, e.g. stm32f429xx.
therefore, at the front will have a table comparing memory, number of gpios, etc. for particulars

AXIM, AHB and APB ARM specific
will have a bus matrix (which allows different peripherals to communicate via master and slave ports by requesting and sending data)
off this, have AHB (higher frequency and higher bandwidth).
like to think of AHB as host bus as it feeds into APBs via a bridge. APB1 normally half frequency of APB2
we can see that DMA can go directly to APB without going through bus matrix
So, relevent for speed and clock concerns going through which bus?
Also to know if we are DMA'ing something and CPUing something, they
are not going to be fighting on the same bus, i.e. spread out load
lower power peripherals on lower frequency busses?
this level of knowledge further emphasises need to know hardware to understand what is going on

arm SoC block diagram (datasheet), see d-bus and i-bus to RAM
introduce things like CCM (core coupled cache) 
and ART (adaptive real-time accelerator) that add some more harvard like instruction things
essentially, more busses instead of more cores like in x86, 
(i.e. a lot more than just a CPU to be concerned with)
also have more debug hardware

A real time scheduling algorithm is deterministic (not necessarily fast), i.e. it absolutely must
(soft time is it should)
(real time processing means virtually immediately)
So, a higher priority task will preempt lower priority tasks
FreeRTOS will have a default idle task created by the kernel that is always running
(this idle task gives indication of a low-power mode for free?)

middleware extends OS functionality, drivers give OS functionality

freeRTOS makes money through some commercial licenses (with support), 
middleware (tcp/ip stacks, cli etc.)

TODO: setting freeRTOS interrupt priorities is sometimes done wrong?
tasks are usually infinite loops

freeRTOS is more barebones (only 3 files) and effectively just a scheduler (so has timers, priorities) 
and communication primitives between threads
In most embedded programs, sensors are monitored periodically. Time and functionality are closely related 
For small programs super loop is fine.
However, when creating large programs, this time dependency greatly increases complexity.
So, a priority based real-time scheduler can be used to reduce this time complexity. 
(priority over time-slice more efficient in most cases, as if not operating, can go to sleep)
In addition, schedular allows for logical separation of components (concurrent team development) 
Also allows easy utilisation of changing hardware, e.g. multiple processor cores
COTS (commercial-off-the-shelf) as opposed to bespoke

what would a segfault â coredump look like on bare-metal?

function reentrant if can be swapped out and its execution rentered
functions that operate on global structures and employ lock-based sychronisation (could encounter deadlocks if called from signal handler) (and are thread-safe)
like malloc and printf are not reentrant 

synchronisation constructs:
* lock (only one thread access at a time)
* mutex (lock that can be shared by multiple processes)
* semaphore (can allow many threads access at a time)

embedded systems special purpose, constrained, 
often real time (product may be released in regulated environment standardsd, e.g. automotive, rail, defence, medical etc.)
challenges are testabilty and software/hardware comprimises for optimisation problem solving, e.g. bit-banging or cheap mcu, external timer or in-built timer, adding hardware increases power consumption, e.g. ray tracing card or just rasterisation, big.LITTLE clusters
1/4 scalar performance for 1/2 power consumption good tradeoff

documentation:
There are of course international standards (IEC 60601, or IEC 62304) that you have 
to follow in order to get your device CE/FDA approval.
These standards usually require to provide a lot of documentation and to pass a 
series of tests in order to verify that your device is working as intended 
and it's not dangerous.

APB and AHB are specific to arm mcus?

full-duplex can still be serial, requiring at least two wires (duplex meaning bidirectional)

USART can act synchronously, i.e. is clocked. so no stop/start bits meaning higher baud rate

baud rate is signalling element, bandwidth is bits (can be different)

ART (adaptive real-time accelerator) is like a prefetch into a particular cache to speed up access times?

STM32 HAL drivers are not optimised, so will probably slow down in timing critical code
e.g. they have to take into account corner cases not applicable to us

compare pins from STM32 .ioc file with schematic file
schematic may show we don't need to enable a pull-up/down resistor in MCU as there
may be an external one already

external oscillators will also appear in schematic

clock configuration diagram very useful from cube ide
when working in power efficient systems, 
want to know how to change sysclock and peripheral clock speeds

using HAL, might have to replace later because slow or too general purpose.
also, HAL might not adhere to particular safety standards like MISRA

autogenerating the code from cube fills with lots of annoying comments.
if you don't put code in these comments and regenerate from .ioc, will lose code...
this is because going back and forth between .ioc will autogenerate more code

USART can be used as UART
