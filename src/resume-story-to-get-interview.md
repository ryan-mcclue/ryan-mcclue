Conferral in Dec, graduate in May

As a final-year Bachelor of Computer Science student at the University of New South Wales, 
I'm passionate about using programming to solve emerging problems.
I believe I can apply this mindset to assist with delivering frontend and backend solutions for web based technologies.
I operate with a colloborative mindset, ensuring that I will maximise the opportunity of an IT Internship to better myself as a software engineer.
I'm excited to apply my technical skills developed through personal projects and university studies in a
real world setting to help provide business value.

Navy (July - December 2020)
• Leading a class of 24, coordinating marching drills and other basic training fundamentals.
• Balancing individual responsibilities such as kit maintenance with group requirements such as unit readiness whilst adhering to military schedules and protocols.
• Working in a team of 6 to clean living areas, stations and managing inventory.
• Performing weekly early morning activities at 4am and completing intensive milestone events.


Guide Dogs NSW/ACT is the leading provider of Guide Dogs and mobility services that enable people with low vision to get around their communities safely and independently.
I decided to volunteer there because of my father's work with visually impaired children and to help improve other people's lives.
As a volunteer puppy raiser, my duties included taking the dog on regular walks, performing obedience training and engaging in socialisation experiences.

Problem Solving: Developed a multithreaded asynchronous file loader in music visualiser app that reduced file processing time by 50%
Team Colloboration: Effectively coordinated with team in the Navy to ensure high standards of cleanliness, unit readiness and presentation were met
Attention To Detail: Programmed z-sorted push buffer for UI widgets in music visualiser app, preventing overlapping elements from both consuming input events 
Leadership: Led class in the Navy during marching drills, ensuring all individuals were aligned with strict military schedule and protocols.

**Music Player GUI**, 2024
Created a cross-platform music visualiser in C/C++.
Implemented an immediate mode UI from scratch using low-level graphics APIs resulting in a responsive user experience.
Hotreloading
Reduced FFT latency by converting algorithm to SIMD, lowering execution time from ... to ...
Improved code integrity by incorporating a CI pipeline that performed static analysis and runtime analysis, enhancing security.
(static analysis picked up on branch of mem_push returning NULL if requesting beyond arena capacity)
(address sanitisier picked up memcpying from null address with zero size which is undefined)
Metaprogramming to enhance developer workflow
Hosted on a Launchpad PPA, setting up a packaging workflow allowing for easy installation and updates on Debian based systems.

**Robot Arm Controller**, 2024
Developed a 2-joint stepper motor robot on an STM32 microcontroller in bare metal MISRA C/C++.
Designed non-blocking I2C, SPI and UART drivers by reading datasheets and using interrupts, allowing for real time operations.
Created a system bootloader that allowed signed firmware updates, providing system flexibility and integrity.
Wrote a console subsystem that enabled device logging and interaction, facilitating python HIL testing to improve system reliability.
Performed hardware debugging with JTAG, logic analyser, oscilloscope and multimeter, giving insight to signal timings to verify system.
Reduced power usage by incorporating sleep modes, lowering average current usage from ... to ...

**Marine Technician - Royal Australian Navy**, HMAS Cerberus, 2020
Lead class of 24 by coordinating marching drills and other basic training fundamentals,
demonstrating strong communication skills.
Worked in a team of 6 to clean living areas, perform kit maintenance and provide peer support, 
learning how to collaborate in a team environment.
Performed weekly early morning activities at 4am and completed milestone events
