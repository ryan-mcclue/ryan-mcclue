Show what is impressive about you with projects (perhaps even draw a diagram, how things communicated, api headers etc.)

Pick 1-2 projects that you'll be able to explain strongly.  The more current, the better.  
communication-aspect: project stories: what you did, how you did it, result

Talk about languages, apis, protocols, how I got things to communicate, used in your projects

Navy:
- most challenging
- best failures/learning from mistake
     - want to implement safegaurds to not let it happen again
     - the process has failed, so change that; not necessarily the person
- most interesting
- conflict with teammate (will have to be university projects; or navy shakedown?)
Can you tell me a time where you had a conflict with a teammate? How did you
deal with it?
    + design doc discussion; have team write pros and cons of options
    + ask questions instead of saying outwrite wrong so other person can learn
    + take initiative and build a prototype to demonstrate idea; take responsibility for my actions

- Talk about a time showed leadership
- Accept Feedback (performance review navy?) (want to show accept changes to maintain an upwards trajectory)
