Why do you want to work here?
What projects have you done?
What is your visa status?
Why did you leave your last job?
What are you looking for?
Do you want full-time or part-time?
What type of role do you want?

Pick 1-2 projects that you'll be able to explain strongly.  The more current, the better.  If they ask "So how are you, what have you been up to?  Tell me where you're at now..."  Prepare an answer for this.

take notes. It's great to keep notes on the interviewer's name & role, so you can later ask questions about their position. 

Onsite:
how to ask about why I should work here, i.e. what can they offer me over competing places?
Talk about languages, apis, protocols, how I got things to communicate, used in your projects
Show you have fundamentals to grow into a leader in company
1-2 technically interesting problems worked on in projects, with STAR
white-boarding code do simplist thing first
Prepare a strong response to "So, tell me about yourself.  What brings you here?"
    Have a cordial, concise, and friendly self-introduction that piques curiosity.  Avoid arrogance!  Many interviewers will dive straight into a coding problem -- this is OK, but if you can pique their curiosity enough to have them ask you more about some project you've done, you will start off stronger.
    2-3 technical projects you can talk about concisely.  Identify key points you've done (not what your team did).
Start thinking about some interesting stories you can talk about that show technical challenge.
Be prepared to talk about the top 2-3 points on your resume.  Re-arrange your resume a bit if you need to, or add projects to them so you can point to them.
Show what is impressive about you with projects (perhaps even draw a diagram, how things communicated, api headers etc.)
From projects, say you are passionate and ethusiastic about learning new things
Willing to improve skills, hope job can better myself as a software engineer
Whiteboard have pesudo-methods, e.g. validate_input(). 
talk about space/time complexity, performance, readability, etc.
