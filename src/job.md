Do you want full-time or part-time?
What type of role do you want?

Pick 1-2 projects that you'll be able to explain strongly.  The more current, the better.  If they ask "So how are you, what have you been up to?  Tell me where you're at now..."  Prepare an answer for this.

take notes. It's great to keep notes on the interviewer's name & role, so you can later ask questions about their position. 

4. Onsite:
how to ask about why I should work here, i.e. what can they offer me over competing places?
Talk about languages, apis, protocols, how I got things to communicate, used in your projects
Show you have fundamentals to grow into a leader in company
1-2 technically interesting problems worked on in projects, with STAR
white-boarding code do simplist thing first. remember to communicate what doing.
key areas: code, dalgo, communication/analysis, KISS
Prepare a strong response to "So, tell me about yourself.  What brings you here?"
    Have a cordial, concise, and friendly self-introduction that piques curiosity.  Avoid arrogance!  Many interviewers will dive straight into a coding problem -- this is OK, but if you can pique their curiosity enough to have them ask you more about some project you've done, you will start off stronger.
    2-3 technical projects you can talk about concisely.  Identify key points you've done (not what your team did).
Start thinking about some interesting stories you can talk about that show technical challenge.
Be prepared to talk about the top 2-3 points on your resume.  Re-arrange your resume a bit if you need to, or add projects to them so you can point to them.
Show what is impressive about you with projects (perhaps even draw a diagram, how things communicated, api headers etc.)
From projects, say you are passionate and ethusiastic about learning new things
Willing to improve skills, hope job can better myself as a software engineer
Whiteboard have pesudo-methods, e.g. validate_input().

    Friendly collaboration
    Technical curiosity
    Learning from mistakes
    Willingness to accept feedback and improve oneself

My projects show I'm proactive and ready to hit the ground running
e.g. for stm32 have to dig in driver codespace and docs
I can learn things quickly
e.g. bluetooth same etc.
will need to complete somewhat, so can be results driven
2-3 interesting technical stories.

Show humble and able to listen to feedback
Show got more to learn

As embedded a lot of 'roll-your-own', I know it's important to be able to dig into a datasheet

Hi there,
I saw your job posting on Hacker News and it sounds like an interesting opportunity!
To introduce myself a little, I'm a generalist full stack web developer and have been developing
apps over the past several years. My most well known projects have been X, Y, and Z. X is a
social network / dating site that I grew to 2 million users. Y is a social game that began on
Facebook with 1.5 million users, which I later brought to iPhone. Z is an open source GitHub
framework that I am developing. Most of my tech stack has been built on Python, React.js,
MySql, HTML, and CSS so I feel my background would fit well with <your_company>.
Here are the URLs of some of my previous work.
http://x.com/
http://y.com/
Please let me know if you'd like to chat. I'll also attach a resume.
Cheers,
<your name>
