Hi my name is Ryan McClue, and here is a demonstration of my music visualiser program.

All these UI features are implemented from scratch without a UI library.

On startup, the text will flash red according to the most recent mouse movement.

If I drag a host of music files into the program, the most recent one begins to play.
The display is an FFT visualisation of the music file.

To make the waveform display more uniform, 
the bar scale is logarithmic and the height is based of square root.

I can pause the music.
Resume it, rewind it and fast forward it.

If I drag more files into the program, a scroll bar will appear 
and I can select other music files to play.

ACTION: 
As the program is hot-reloadable, I can make changes to the program without restarting it. 
For example, I can change the color of the active music file to orange.

Thank you for watching this demonstration and have a great day.
